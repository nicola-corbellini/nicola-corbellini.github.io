Doctoral Consortium paper published in the context of the International Conference on Multimodal Interaction ([ICMI 2022](https://icmi.acm.org/2022/)) illustrating the goals and stages of my PhD project. Namely, the development of a computational model of [group potency][1] a machine could be endowed with in the perspective of building [Hybrid Intelligence][2] systems.
