This is the first study published in the context of my PhD project. As baseline models, we trained three state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm to classify small team interactions as being low or high in potency. Data were gathered from three famous datasets on social interaction, namely [AMI corpus](https://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/ami/corpus/), [GAME-ON](https://grace.wp.imt.fr/the-game-on-dataset/) and [TA2](https://www.idiap.ch/en/dataset/ta2). \
The study was presented at the 12th International Workshop on Human Behavior Understanding ([HBU22](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/hbu/2022/)), satellite event of the [ICPR 2022](https://www.icpr2022.com/) international conference .
