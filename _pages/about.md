## Bio

I'm a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at <a href="http://casapaganini.it/index_eng.php">  Casa Paganini, InfoMus</a>, in the DIBRIS department of the University of Genoa. I have a background in *Cognitive Psychology* and *Digital Humanities*, but I love *Computer Science*. Indeed, I'm a self-taught programmer and a **Machine Learning** (ML) enthusiast. I like to follow online courses to strengthen my skills and understanding in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence related fields and I like to collect course <a href='/portfolio/'>certificates</a>. 

I strongly believe the integration of ML technology in everyday life could improve the quality of people's lives and their knowledge of themselves and help reduce humans' biases. We can achieve this by exploiting the complementary nature of humans and machines, with the goal of building **Hybrid Intelligence** systems. From this perspective, the aim of my research project is the automatic detection of the confidence a group of people has in its capabilities, namely **Group potency**. The project is guided by the vision of building a machine able to devise a strategy that can regulate people's confidence, in hybrid human-machines teams.
